# Average Computer

At the end of the semester we have to compute final averages.

Here is a rough little script I use to compute averages.

Usually most of the class gets an A. 

Anyone who gets less - I manually review his / her grades to make sure there is
no bug in the code.

## How to use
* read the script and verify it suits your needs
* modify as necessary
* run it like this `./compute_averages.py your_csv_file.csv`
